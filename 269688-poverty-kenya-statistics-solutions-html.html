Poverty eradication is a difficult task for this country’s people. Half of Kenya is very poor even in the year 2018. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The latest report from UNICEF shows that an approximate of 46% Kenyans fall below the poverty line.</a> Things may not look very hard for Kenya when we read papers and watch a few news bulletins but in reality, there are some things we probably do not know of and sometimes overlook the poverty in Kenya. In this article, we will get an insight of how things really are in our country.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/163b08d551ccbcd2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 10 most conservative countries in the world in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Kenya is a country of economic and social inequalities. Due to the many contrasts of which Kenya is a country of, huge segments of the population struggle every day. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to the World Bank report</a>, the people in the world below the poverty line are earning less than two Dollars each day. The people are vulnerable to social, economic, and climatic changes. Many Kenyans have access to basic education, healthcare, sanitation and clean water. Because of these mixed reasons, Millennium Development Goals progress regarding social security is also mixed.</p><p class=align-left>In 2010, Kenya enacted a new constitution. This constitution mainly focused on the demographic, historic, geographic, and violation of human rights. The reason for this formation was to address these issues which have barricaded progress in the country for a long time. This exemption let the power from the National Government devolve to the 47 newly decentralized counties.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/33579f468953d79e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best African countries to live and work in 2020</span></p></a><h3>Causes of poverty in Kenya</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/163b08d551ccbcd2.jpeg><h3>1. Poverty in rural areas is really high</h3><p class=align-left>It might seem like the whole of Kenya is poverty-stricken, but that is not how it really is. You can connect poverty to a few definite regions on the basis of social or political influence. Agriculture is the main pillar of Kenya. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">79% of the country’s population practice farming</a> and it is sad to see that the same population who bestow the country with food is the poorest.</p><h3>2. The rich and the poor co-exist</h3><p class=align-left>Generally, the society’s poor live by themselves in the slums while the prosperous fill up the residential areas and communities. But in this country, the slums are right beside the urbanized areas. The affluent are dependent on the poor for house management. This is how it works out in Kenya. If only the poor were paid better, things would be different.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ec78c3dd2a2e08ac.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Average salary in Kenya monthly and annually per person in 2024</span></p></a><h3>3. Fault in the system</h3><p class=align-left>The government is supposed to be at the frontline holding back poverty from striking the country’s people, but it seems like things do not work out in the same way in Kenya.<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to Transparency International</a>, Kenya is one of the most corrupt nations. The officials are probably one of the biggest reasons why people in Kenya are still poverty-stricken. They are stealing from the poor people and make them pay bribes which contributes to the poverty levels in Kenya.</p><h3>4. Not enough scope</h3><p class=align-left>Lack of business and employment opportunities in Kenya is one of the key reasons behind the poverty in our country. A lot of people need to rely on farming for their income. There is a scarcity of jobs in Kenya which gives the people no sense of employment. People also face many hurdles when they decide to set up a business in Kenya.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/750623d3de43fbd7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>12 richest people in Tanzania in 2024 and their net worth</span></p></a><h3>5. The contribution of the western countries</h3><p class=align-left>You will come across reports on different business projects which are initiated in Kenya. Most of these projects are taken up by western countries via NGOs and/or economic partnerships. The fact that a lot of people miss out on is that despite gigantic profits being made, most of them are not spent in Kenya.</p><h3>6. Lack of education</h3><p class=align-left>We often talk about how this world should maintain equilibrium; how everything should be made equal for everybody. We discuss the necessity of education in the developing countries and how proper education can make people not only educated but also literate. But when we are talking about educating the poor areas of the world, we should also think how, and what should be done in order to make education available to everyone conveniently.</p><p class=align-left>Education in Kenya is not well furnished because it is expensive. Out of all the things in the world, this is one element in life which should not cost us much. Unfortunately, with more development, the world is turning totally business-centric. And this is why education in Kenya is not affordable to the poor people. Poor Kenyans are unable to see the merits of getting educated and this results in lack of opportunities for making money.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs77qqoue8oip.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Big Four Agenda of the government explained</span></p></a><h3>7. The population balloon</h3><p class=align-left>It is a well-known fact that bigger households require more money and it is safe to assume that poor families will have a lower birth rate. This is not the case in Kenya, however. The poor people in Kenya have an average of 4-6 children in every household as compared to the affluent who only have a child or two. This also contributes to the higher poverty level in Kenya.</p><h2>Contradictions in a country of contrasts</h2><p class=align-left>A country still trying to develop itself is not expected to have much of a lifestyle but you will be surprised to find out the big number of expensive luxury cars, high-end yachts, and the number of rich people in Kenya.</p><p class=align-left>You will not find many people who are contributing to the development of the nation or helping out the poor and the needy. Although there are enough capable wealthy individuals who can help turn the tables, even if an inch, you won’t see anybody trying.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs601rv4nmj1b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Causes of drought in Kenya, its effects & solutions</span></p></a><p class=align-left>That being said, when you visit the slums in Kenya, you will find the poor people handling the latest technologies like laptops and smartphones. This might seem odd since they are slum inhabitants who are supposedly poor. But Kenyans have a different perspective towards life. They believe in living the present and not worrying about the future.</p><p class=align-left>It might hold some advantages sometimes but it is not really a good perspective in a world which is changing fast. When people of this country learn to change their approach and start saving for the future, they will automatically start making progress without even realizing it.</p><h2>Effects of poverty in Kenya</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/33579f468953d79e.jpeg><p class=align-left>It does not matter which country we are talking about when we discuss the effects of poverty. Many people regard poverty as a curse. While we are not dealing with theoretical philosophy right now, there should be a more practical reason to believe. We do not know if poverty is really a curse or is it just the mistakes people make. But this much can be said that as long as poverty is not eradicated, development will progress slowly.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs18k54193rc1.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Exploring the Wonders of Kenya: A Comprehensive Guide to the Country’s Main Tourist Attractions</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Let us talk about some of the effects which poverty has glued to the country and its people.</p><p class=align-left>Poverty is a kind of situation which gets installed in our heads just like malicious software installed on our computers. It is a kind of fear that stops people from being able to explore the qualities they have in them. Simply put, those who have sculpted the shape of their identity with poverty do not possibly see themselves in a rich position. And if you do not believe in yourself, you will be doomed to regress despite having all the essential qualities.</p><p class=align-left>The feeling of negativity is a big reason as of why almost half the Kenyan population is below the poverty line. Poverty has pushed Kenyans to the pits of depression, barrenness, and pessimism which have contributed to the population degrading down to alcoholism and turning into criminalists.</p><p class=align-left>There will not be progressive changes as long as the people stick to doing the same things over and over again while anticipating better results.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs7jkf8lf6bfq.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Which are the provincial secondary schools in Kenya?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Lack of dissemination of proper information to the population is another reason behind why Kenya sees more regress than progress. The citizens should be made able to access basic information through which they can turn their way of thinking and perspective about the world and about their individual lives better and helpful.</p><p class=align-left>In brief, poverty in Kenya has resulted in the following detrimental effects:</p><ul><li>Lower literacy rate</li><li>Increased crime rate</li><li>Low social mobility</li><li>Increased feeling of social insecurity</li><li>Proliferation of diseases and short life expectancy</li><li>Social tensions and inequality conflicts</li></ul><h2>Poverty reduction strategies in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>In 2008, a long-term development project was launched in Kenya. This blueprint was named Vision 2030 and its main objective is a prosperous and competitive country with high-quality life by 2030. This project has been initiated to guide the nation and take it forward so as to meet the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. This blueprint also aims to alter a developing Kenya into a new industrialized and middle-income nation.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs1pt9nms8fi8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Importance of agriculture in Kenya economy</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Government of Kenya understands the fact that economic progress there mainly depends on agriculture, manufacturing, energy sector, and tourism.

It can be made possible by maximizing agricultural smallholding productivity and increasing non-farming activities. The Government of Kenya looks forward to vitalizing the rural economy by making financial services available to the backward communities and enabling the growth of smallholding enterprises.</p><p class=align-left>Kenya came across forbidding blocks in June 2011 when the drought called the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Horn of Africa left 150,000 refugees and 3.75 million Kenyans</a> in need of compassion and aid.

Most people tend to miss the truth that children are the pillars of the nation. It is necessary for every child to not just learn to read and write, but be literate cultured. There is a fine line between being educated and being literate. Education is what is going to change the perspective of an individual and show him/her what life is all about and how it should be dealt with.</p><p class=align-left>If it is necessary to solve a nation’s problems, there is hardly any point in trying to fix the minds of the adults, but the children. A mind injected with years of ideas and facts cannot be easily altered. But the new generation can be moulded into a strong set of pillars which will support the development and growth of the nation as a whole.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs7jmcush6ino.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>A Highlight of the Most Corrupt Countries in Africa: Is Kenya There?</span></p></a><h2>Indicators of poverty in Kenya</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs29mbp2t4ft0g.jpeg><p class=align-left>It is to be noted that the historical patterns of the inequity in terms of poverty only means that there are also some critical challenges. It was found that the children are facing kind of deprivation issues. This can be solved only by focusing on the added support to budgeting, service delivery and planning.</p><p class=align-left>Corruption is also a very effective poverty indicator in Kenya. The money that is sent for development of the country is mostly driven towards the pockets of interested groups. This is only making things worse in terms of overall development and poverty eradication in the country.</p><h2>Poverty levels in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>Luxury has a different meaning in Kenya; basic sources of livelihood are often considered as luxurious items in Kenya. However, the poverty levels can be understood briefly as under the following points:</p><li>Most of the poor people in Kenya are living in the rural areas.</li><li>Almost half of the population are living in poverty.</li><li>The AIDS/HIV outbreak drove a large number of Kenyans to poverty.</li><li>Unpredictable and devastating weather and climatic factors have also contributed to the high poverty levels.</li><li>The abjectly poor communities have taken shelter in the northern regions of the country.</li><li>The uncontrollable population growth has helped in straining services and infrastructure, hence leading more Kenyans towards poverty.</li><li>Excessive corruption lowers down poverty-fighting efforts.</li><li>When it is about the increased poverty levels, the women are considered as a vulnerable group.</li><li>The growth in the literacy levels did not affect the poverty levels in Kenya.</li><li>Kenya lags economic diversity which has caused the poverty levels to increase.</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs54eradjvtg3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How Many Kenyans Belong to the Richest People in Africa?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Most of the Kenyans are living in the places where there is a higher potential for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">agriculture which comprises an approximate of 18% of the total area of the country</a>. This shows how stressed the resources are. This is definitely not enough for providing the basic amount of income to the Kenyans.
