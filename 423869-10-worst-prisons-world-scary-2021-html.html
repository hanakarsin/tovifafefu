But, unfortunately, that is not always the case because, for such a place with some of the most hardcore criminals in the <a href=#>world</a>, even those who find themselves there for minor offences have to harden to survive. No one fancies themselves being thrown into the worst prisons in the world because anything can happen to anyone there.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/dcd672db7daf2382.jpeg><p class=align-left>Nothing seems to go right inside the world’s worst prisons. The inmates' human rights are usually violated by the authorities who view their clients as lesser humans. On their part, inmates do little to help themselves as they disregard authority and are stone-cold towards fellow inmates. This creates a toxic environment for wardens, inmates, and even guests.</p><h2>The worst prisons in the world</h2><p class=align-left>In these scariest prisons in the world, you have to constantly look over your shoulder regardless of whether you are a warden, <a href=#>police</a>, lawyer or inmate. If you lose focus for a second, you might end up dead by being stabbed or punched.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d59cf20581aa3dc7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 worst prisons in Africa: Which country has the toughest jails?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Despite being maximum <a href=#>security</a> facilities, drugs find their way into most of these prisons, and the presence of cartels establishes a form of hierarchy amongst inmates.</p><h3>1. Gitarama Prison, Rwanda</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d59cf20581aa3dc7.jpeg><p class=align-left>Very few prisons are as crowded as the Gitarama Prison of Rwanda. This facility houses more than 7,000 inmates despite having been built for a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">capacity of 400 inmates</a> only. As you might have guessed, many of the Gitarama prison inmates are suspects of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.</p><p class=align-left>Because of the overcrowding, inmates stand barefoot on the filthy ground most of the time, and this causes their feet to rot. As a result, many inmates have required amputations but die due to a lack of medical attention. The facility has only one doctor revealing the shortage of staffing for essential services, which is why it is among the harshest prisons in the world.</p><h3>2. Camp 22, North Korea</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/746593fd90c81e54.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Prisoners in America Get Second Chances, Bag Degrees While Serving Jail Term</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/f6b8c2fafd525d94.jpeg><p class=align-left>Camp 22 is like one large prison in which everyone's rights do not matter apart from those of the supreme leader. One can imagine what conditions would be like in this concentration <a href=#>camp </a>that has been operational since 1965. Torturing prisoners is the order of the day here, making it one of the world’s most dangerous prisons.</p><p class=align-left>The prison is home to more than 50,000 men, women, and children. This is because, in North Korea, an entire <a href=#>family</a> can be arrested for one person's crimes. In addition, with the food shortage problem in the country, prisoners are malnourished, and they still have to work in fields and mines for up to 12 hours a day all week long.</p><h3>3. United States Penitentiary, Administrative Maximum Facility (ADX), USA</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/746593fd90c81e54.jpeg><p class=align-left>The ADX was built in 1994 and is the most maximum-security prison in the USA. Here, you can find some of the most dangerous criminals globally, such as serial killers and terrorists. Some of the prisoners include Ramzi Yousef (bombed World Trade Center in 1993), Zacarias Moussaoui (involved in 9/11 attacks), and Ted Kaczynski (the Unabomber).</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/281898ab3ddfce37.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of all prisons in Kenya and where they are located</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Inmates spend up to 23 hours a day in solitary confinement in cells that measure 7-by-12 ft. Even the furniture in the cells is made of concrete and is immovable. Cell windows measure 3-by-4 inches. Inmates get out of the cells for one hour for recreation, and they do so in several restraints and under tight security. Still, it is the most dangerous prison in the world.</p><h3>4. Rikers Island Prison, USA</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/9842c894c18f0f48.jpeg><p class=align-left>Nothing good can be expected from prison on an island. For example, the Rikers Island Prison has ten separate jails for men, women, and youth. This prison is known for excessive violence, runaway corruption, and gross mistreatment of prisoners. In addition, there are many cases of inmates having mental issues due to the treatment they undergo.</p><p class=align-left>An<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> investigation revealed </a>an organization of inmates called The Program, which prison guards formed to exert violence to other inmates as a way of establishing order. The prison has one of the highest rates of solitary confinement in America, forcing the Department of Corrections to build an additional 1000 units for adolescents and inmates with mental illnesses. Rikers Island is probably the toughest prison in the world.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a26114cf10cc77c5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 15 most difficult actors to work with in Hollywood 2021</span></p></a><h3>5. Mendoza Prison, Argentina</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/e769db3e74f381b6.jpeg><p class=align-left>This prison is also overcrowded, with inmates three times over its capacity. Small cells measuring four square meters <a href=#>house</a> as many as five inmates. The hygiene in the facility is dilapidated due to the lack of a proper sewage system. Inmates have no option but to use plastic bags and bottles as their washrooms.</p><p class=align-left>The Mendoza Prison inmates rarely access even the most basic medical care. The only time prisoners come into contact with a doctor is when they are dead. Prison guards also torture inmates.</p><h3>6. Diyarbakir Prison, Turkey</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/281898ab3ddfce37.jpeg><p class=align-left>The prison is a hellhole even for those prisoners who do not seek to create any problem. Diyarbakir Prison has a bad reputation as the prison with the highest number of human rights violations per inmate. This means every inmate would have undergone more than one human rights violation during their stay there.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/4d89567e78ab0719.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of top 10 most toxic fandoms in the world as of 2022</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The forms of torture practised in prison are physical and mental, making it the deadliest prison in the world. Inmates have to undergo abuse daily, resulting in many inmates opting for suicide as the easy way out. Those who try to speak up end up being severely punished.</p><h3>7. La Sabaneta Prison, Venezuela</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/e03b1068e307c9ef.jpeg><p class=align-left>Initially, the prison was constructed to hold 700 inmates, but it has been overcrowded to a high number of 3700 inmates. Due to the high population in such a small place, inmates are involved in constant fights, and it is also a breeding ground for diseases.</p><p class=align-left>Probably the most brutal prison in the world, it has been rocked with corruption scandals with claims of prison guards giving preferential treatment to those inmates with money and power. Such inmates do not participate in any activities but have other inmates do their chores for them.</p><h3>8. Terre Haute, USA</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0a721d60b5080cdd.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ famous Ethiopian proverbs about love, life, and education</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a26114cf10cc77c5.jpeg><p class=align-left>The prison is divided into low-security, medium-security, and maximum-security units. It is in this prison that the federal government's execution chamber is found. In addition, there is a particular confinement unit for death row inmates with small horrible prison cells.</p><p class=align-left>Death row inmates' cells are tiny, and the prisoners leave those cells only three times a week when they are taken to the exercise cages. Death row inmates such as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (the Boston Marathon bomber) live in the tiny cells as they wait for their execution.</p><h3>9. San Quentin State Prison, USA</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/a40e78f84a7a0ab9.jpeg><p class=align-left>The San Quentin State Prison is the oldest prison in California, and for some reason, it has been able to preserve some outdated things such as torturing prisoners. The prison ranks at the top when it comes to violence. It has housed several infamous criminals such as Scott Peterson, Charles Manson, and Sirhan Sirhan, who assassinated Robert F. Kennedy.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/163b08d551ccbcd2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 10 most conservative countries in the world in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The prison has California's only death row facility for male inmates. It is also the only prison in the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">state with a gas chamber</a>. In the past, the prison has had several corruption scandals and interracial riots incited by guards.</p><h3>10. Guantanamo Bay, Cuba</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/793d04c52d3f0ae8.jpeg><p class=align-left>Guantanamo Bay is an American-owned prison found on the eastern tip of Cuba. It was opened in 2002 after the 9/11 attacks with the purpose of housing Taliban and al-Queda prisoners who had been captured in Afghanistan. During President Barack Obama's tenure, he promised to close the prison, but it remains open today.</p><p class=align-left>The prison houses about 150 prisoners in two camps, Camp Iguana and Camp Delta. Before 2002, Guantanamo Bay was a temporary holding facility until its closure. Then, torture was used to try to get information from suspected terrorists.</p><p class=align-left>The conditions inside the worst prisons in the world are so scary that even the people who work there are left traumatized for the rest of their lives. It is common to witness murders daily, and the worst cases of violence men are capable of. Yet, going into such prisons is a condemnation that few have overcome and come out reformed.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9fc6af29b8c6e4b5.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 20 least marketable courses in Kenya in 2024 (updated)</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> shared an article about the most <a href=#>dangerous African countries</a> to visit in 2020.
