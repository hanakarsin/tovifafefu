We've seen it happen in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sex & the City</a> with the whole Shayla fiasco, and who could forget <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">George Costanza's "Seven" diatribe</a>?</p><p>People get understandably very crazy when it comes to their children's names, especially if you always dreamed of having a bouncing little baby and spent a ton of time daydreaming how you'd raise them. Some people plan the kind of bedroom the little nugget will sleep in, the first solid food to feed them — all of that good stuff. And of course you're going to want to come up with the perfect name for your future offspring. There are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tons of books</a> written about the subject and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even different philosophies about how names can affect the course of your life</a>.</p><p>While some people take the whole baby naming thing to ridiculous new heights — <a href=#>like this woman</a> — many come up with deeply emotional and personal names for their children.</p><p>The person who penned this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> post</a> planned on using a name for her future child that was suggested by her mother. It's a super unique moniker and represents not only the poster's relationship with her mother, but where her mom came from as well.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><p>The name took on an extra special meaning for the poster when her mama passed away, which makes what happened between with her friend that much worse.</p><p>When OP discovered that her friend was pregnant, she was obviously stoked for her and they quickly started discussing baby names. Her friend then asked her if she had any in mind for her future children and that's when she told her the whole story involving her mom.</p><p>Fast forward to our narrator browsing Facebook and seeing photos of her best friend's sonogram online, along with not only a pregnancy announcement, but that the proud mom-to-be already picked out a name for the bouncing baby. OP's heart sank when she saw the name was the exact one she told her friend, in confidence, that she planned to give her future daughter.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><p>After most definitely wiping the look of shock off her face, she confronted her friend about her name-stealing and asked her if she would reconsider changing the baby's name because of her personal connection to it.</p><p>Her friend's reaction, unfortunately, makes it seem like she doesn't really care too much about their friendship.</p><p>According to OP, her friend said she decided on using the name anyway and went on to say that, because she got pregnant first, she gets to use whatever name she wants. Oh, and that "it's just a name" so OP shouldn't get that upset about it.</p><p>Personally, the argument "it's just a ______" never really made much sense to me. If it doesn't mean that much, than you could just as easily change your mind and do me a solid, right?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><p>She was gutted by her friend's decision to take such a hard stance and basically not care about her feelings at all on the matter. What's even worse is that she had to find out about the name-theft through a Facebook post.</p><p>After asking reddit if she would be in the wrong for cutting off all ties with his friend as a result, the majority of people seemed to take her side.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><p>They thought that it was pretty sneaky of her "BFF" to take the name without telling her and even worse to be so unapologetic about it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><p>Had I just read the title of the woman's post, I have to admit I would have thought she was overreacting a bit. However, after reading the full story, it became clear her "friend" straight-up burgled the name despite knowing how much it meant to her. Even if it was an honest mistake or she didn't think there was anything wrong with taking it, she clearly doesn't value their friendship if she's not willing to change her daughter's name as a result.</p><p>What do you think? Is OP in the right here? Or was that a really lame thing for her friend to do?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mmZ%2BeXajBpq3LrGSbmZKueq%2BtzJ4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwoman-bff-steals-baby-name.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwoman-bff-steals-baby-name.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwoman-bff-steals-baby-name.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwoman-bff-steals-baby-name.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwoman-bff-steals-baby-name.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwoman-bff-steals-baby-name.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-cheyenne-from-teen-mom-dating-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-cheyenne-from-teen-mom-dating-now.html>'Teen Mom' Star Cheyenne Floyd and Zach Davis Are Officially Married</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lil-jon-html.html>Lil Jon - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lil-jon-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
