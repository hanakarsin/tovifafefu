It centers around 20 single men and women who are in their 30s and 40s who are successful in their careers but who aren't as lucky in love.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The show focuses on men's perspectives, and the contestants all hail from the same city each season. For Season 3, the cast isolated together at a resort due to COVID-19 restrictions.</p><p>On the Dec. 18 episode, the teaser revealed that "bad news" was set to affect one of the contestants and that it could cause him or her to leave the resort for good. Many are now suspecting that it involves fan-favorite <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joy Hutton</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>What happened to Joy on Ready to Love: Last Resort?&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is the 'Ready to Love: Last Resort' bad news?</h2><p>At the end of the Dec. 18 episode, the teaser revealed that host Nephew Tommy Miles will sit the remaining contestants down for a serious discussion.</p><p>"Normally, when I gather you guys like this, we're talking about trying to find someone in your life," he said. "This is a little bit different. We got some bad news earlier today."</p><p>The episode ended right after Nephew Tommy's ominous words, leading many viewers to wonder about what exactly he's referring to. One popular theory is that it has to do with Joy Hutton, the 38-year-old consultant firm owner.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Joy on 'Ready to Love: Last Resort'?</h2><p>While the exact "bad news" on Ready to Love: Last Resort will be revealed on the Jan. 1 episode, fans do believe that it involves Joy Hutton. When Nephew Tommy announced that there was something serious that the cast needed to discuss, Joy was notably not in the room.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Before Season 3 began airing, Joy posted about the sudden death of her sister, Giana, in September of 2020. The 32-year-old was a graduate of Williams College, and she also had a Master's degree from Carnegie Mellon University.</p><p>Prior to her untimely passing, Giana had just been accepted to a program at George Washington University.&nbsp;</p><p>"On 9/15/2020, I lost my sister unexpectedly after talking to her minutes before," Joy wrote on Instagram, in the first of her many posts about her late sister. "Even in her final moments, in true Giana fashion, she was doing for others. She was on her way to buy a wedding gift for a friend."</p><p>Joy then shared more about who her sister was.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"And in her final words, she was still trying to be the boss of me and tell me how to live my life. She was so protective of her big sister as I was of her. Even though we were six years apart, our bond was unbreakable. This hurts so much. My life will never be the same without her. She was my other half," she continued in the caption of her post. I love you every day and now I will miss you every day."</p><p>A few weeks later, Joy posted about the memorial her family held for her sister.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"On 10/1, we celebrated the life of my sister Giana..." she wrote, along with a slideshow of photos of her sister. "I am so grateful for the outpouring of love from her friends and colleagues. She was a walking beam of light. It's going to take a long time for me to have peace with her leaving this Earth. It still doesn't seem real. I will cherish the time and the memories we did have with one another," she concluded, before adding. "I love you Giana...forever."</p><p>If the "bad news" in question is related to Joy, there's every chance that she did leave the show to deal with the family tragedy. Because Season 3 filmed in isolation at a resort, it is unlikely that she could have returned after departing.&nbsp;</p><p>All will be revealed as Season 3 progresses. &nbsp;</p><p>Ready to Love: Last Resort airs on Fridays at 9 p.m. ET on OWN.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSjp6livK950Z6YnbFdqbxuuM6vnA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-joy-on-ready-to-love.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-joy-on-ready-to-love.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-joy-on-ready-to-love.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-joy-on-ready-to-love.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-joy-on-ready-to-love.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-joy-on-ready-to-love.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-happened-to-the-twins-on-rhonj.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-happened-to-the-twins-on-rhonj.html>What Happened to the Twins on RHONJ?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sarati-html.html>Sarati - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sarati-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
