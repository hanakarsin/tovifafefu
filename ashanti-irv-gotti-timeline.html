It was a massive hit when it first popped off in the early 2000s –&nbsp;much like the singer's alleged fling with hip-hop mogul <a href=#>Irv Gotti</a>. Ashanti has traditionally been pretty guarded about her romantic history over the years, and the hitmaker has never publicly commented on whether she was with Irv Gotti or not. Here's a brief look at what really happened between the two, according to Gotti.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Were Ashanti and Irv Gotti actually dating? A timeline of their alleged relationship.</h2><p>Irv Gotti, the rap mogul who founded Murder Inc. Records, brought a fresh-faced Ashanti onto the team in the early 2000s. Not too long after that, she released her self-titled album in 2002. Rumors had swirled about a potential affair between the two at the time, though Ashanti has never publicly commented on the matter. However, the matter resurfaced in a recent episode of Growing Up Hip Hop: New York.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Gotti admitted that he had been prepping for a Murder, Inc. reunion show, except there was one issue: he wasn't exactly on good terms with everyone at the label. Ashanti happened to be included in that list of people. Speaking about Ashanti, his ex-wife Deb Lorenzo said they had been separated when Ashanti and Gotti apparently started dating.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Previously, Gotti admitted in 2017 that he hadn't begun dating until he and ex-wife Lorenzo had been separated. And before that, in an interview with The Breakfast Club, he insisted they never had a physical relationship at all.&nbsp;</p><p>"We didn't have sex," he said. "I never slept with Ashanti," he said. To this day, Ashanti herself has yet to say anything else about&nbsp;it.</p><p>Gotti also recently told Wendy of The Wendy Williams Show that Ashanti isn't the reason he became separated from his ex-wife, saying she's not a "homewrecker."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"No, Ashanti is not a homewrecker, guys. Ashanti had nothing to do with me and Deb. Deb caught me when I was directing 'I Cry' in Baltimore. Deb, being the vicious person she is, she came down unannounced, 'I'm Mrs. Lorenzo, give me the room key.' The door was latched, but she knows I'm in there. That's what broke me and Deb up," he explained.&nbsp;</p><p>He didn't elaborate on the reasons he could have given Deb to come see him unannounced, though – likely his background with cheating during other times.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>To hear Gotti tell it, Ashanti "wasn't even in the picture" when he supposedly had the affair with her. Apparently he hasn't spoken to Ashanti recently, however, saying "we don't speak." Doing so wasn't out of the question, though.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'd talk to her," he said. "It's nothing to me."</p><p>Clearly this situation is a complex one, but without Ashanti's side of the story that's all we have to go on at present. Hopefully she'll go on the record and tell us all the rest of what we need to know.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflsCprc2toGahoqt6qLvTraBmrJmisq21zZ4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fashanti-irv-gotti-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fashanti-irv-gotti-timeline.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fashanti-irv-gotti-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fashanti-irv-gotti-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fashanti-irv-gotti-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fashanti-irv-gotti-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-did-molly-leave-all-ears.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-did-molly-leave-all-ears.html>Why Did Molly Leave All Ears?
