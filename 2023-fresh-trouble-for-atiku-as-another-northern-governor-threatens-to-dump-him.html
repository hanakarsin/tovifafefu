He said based on intelligence, it was discovered some Atiku’s loyalists in Bauchi have been allegedly undermining his re-election bid.</p><p>“What pained the Governor most was that he was the only presidential aspirant who Atiku refused to visit for rapprochement or reconciliation after the primaries.</p><p>“ Bala then seized the opportunity of his recent birthday to organize a mega rally in Bauchi to show his strength to the party and prove that he is not a pushover. Atiku was excited at the rally.”</p><p>Another source added: “The Governor threatened to quit the presidential campaign council since he was not wanted.”</p><h2>Why Atiku Is Angry</h2><p>A PDP leader quoted on the disagreement between Atiku and Mohammed opined that the PDP presidential candidate is not happy the Bauchi State Governor contested the PDP 2023 ticket with him and more importantly, the Governor refused to step down like others.</p><p>This is said to have resulted in mutual suspicion between the two leaders.</p><p>“I think Atiku was unhappy that Bala contested the presidential primary with him from the same Northeast.</p><p>“ Also, when Bala was prevailed upon to step down, he refused. The PDP candidate cannot trust his full commitment to his aspiration,“ the source said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49wZmtoYmh6p77ErJ9mrKKkwqO4xGadqKpdlsGqt9RmmKxlkaO8tbTEq2Snp6Kptaa%2BzWaeqK6Vp7uwvoytn6udkamyr7%2BMraZmnKWivW60yKZm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2023-fresh-trouble-for-atiku-as-another-northern-governor-threatens-to-dump-him.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f2023-fresh-trouble-for-atiku-as-another-northern-governor-threatens-to-dump-him.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f2023-fresh-trouble-for-atiku-as-another-northern-governor-threatens-to-dump-him.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f2023-fresh-trouble-for-atiku-as-another-northern-governor-threatens-to-dump-him.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2023-fresh-trouble-for-atiku-as-another-northern-governor-threatens-to-dump-him.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2023-fresh-trouble-for-atiku-as-another-northern-governor-threatens-to-dump-him.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rivers-apc-stakeholders-request-ministerial-position-for-wike.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rivers-apc-stakeholders-request-ministerial-position-for-wike.html>Rivers APC Stakeholders Request Ministerial Position For Wike</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-plays-big-daddy-ahs-nyc.html>Who Plays Big Daddy?
