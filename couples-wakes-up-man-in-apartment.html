But nowadays, even staying at home, presumably the safest place, can become just as dangerous as going outside.</p><p>One couple discovered this fact firsthand when they crossed paths with an unexpected visitor in their apartment. The couple shared on <a href=#>TikTok</a> what happened when they confronted the unwelcomed guest.</p><p>Here’s the full story!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">A woman recorded her fiancé threatening to “kill” a man who walked into their apartment.</h2><p>In July 2023, a TikToker named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenesis (@official.jenesiss)</a> posted a 54-second video on her TikTok account. During the video, the Columbus, Ohio, native recorded a man wearing a jacket, polo shirt, and shorts. As she zoomed in on the man, he appeared tired, seemingly struggling to open his eyes. The man could also be heard mumbling under his breath while holding a backpack on one shoulder.</p><p>Jenesis’s caption stated the “strange man” she recorded had broken into her and her fiancé’s studio apartment. After he let himself in, the gentleman allegedly stood at the “foot” of the couple’s bed and didn’t make any noise until the couple found him near the bed at 4 am. Scary!!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@official.jenesiss href=#>@official.jenesiss</a><p>my fiancé and I woke up at 4am to a strange man in our studio apartment standing at the foot of our bed. we don't know how long he was in the apartment, but luckily he didnt steal anything or harm us. after demanding him to get out immediately, the police arrived and took care of the rest. he was very obviously mentally ill as he was claiming "joe biden and kamala harris told him to do it." PLEASE lock your doors, stay alert and keep a weapon nearby at all times. you never know when someone crazy is watching you. he could've done anything to us as we slept, but it's only by grace we woke up and caught him before it was too late. please take this as a warning. <a title=burgler href=#>#burgler</a> <a title=burglary href=#>#burglary</a> <a title=robber href=#>#robber</a> <a title=police href=#>#police</a> <a title=crime href=#>#crime</a> <a title=news href=#>#news</a> <a title=mentalhealth href=#>#mentalhealth</a> <a title=safety href=#>#safety</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=safetyfirst href=#>#safetyfirst</a> <a title=staysafe href=#>#staysafe</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Jenesis" href=#>♬ original sound - Jenesis</a></figure><p>Once Jenesis and her fiancé noticed what was happening, they immediately confronted the man and got him out of their apartment. While still recording, Jenesis turned the camera to her fiancé, who told the man he would “kill” him if he didn’t leave and stated he wasn’t “playing” with the stranger.</p><p>Following her fiancé’s threat to the man, she panned the camera back to the intruder, who was now standing in their floor’s hallway. Eventually, the couple called the police, and Jenesis kept the camera going as several officers approached the man and asked him if he lived in the building, to which the man replied, “Not yet.” The police removed the man’s backpack and opened it before the TikTok ended.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@official.jenesiss</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@official.jenesiss</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">It seems that the couple’s door may have been unlocked during the time of their invasion.</h2><p>In addition to showing her and her fiancé’s terrifying experience on TikTok, Jenesis advised her frightened followers not to go through the same experience. After confirming the man didn’t “steal anything” or “harm” her or her fiancé, she mentioned several ways for others to take precautionary measures to avoid having a stranger enter their bedroom.</p><p>“PLEASE lock your doors, stay alert, and keep a weapon nearby at all times,” Jenesis warned her audience. “You never know when someone crazy is watching you. He could've done anything to us as we slept, but it's only by grace we woke up and caught him before it was too late. Please take this as a warning.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@official.jenesiss</a></figure><p>The advice from the TikToker made many commenters who watched the video believe Jenesis and her fiancé may have forgotten to lock the door to the apartment, which would explain how the stranger got into their bedroom.</p><p>While Jenesis didn’t confirm nor deny that’s what happened, she said she believed their intruder was “mentally ill,” as he stated “<a href=#>Joe Biden</a> and <a href=#>Kamala Harris</a> told him" to enter their apartment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLy2vMueqmavkaCytHnUqWSmmZ5itq95wKmYq6ydmru1</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcouples-wakes-up-man-in-apartment.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcouples-wakes-up-man-in-apartment.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcouples-wakes-up-man-in-apartment.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcouples-wakes-up-man-in-apartment.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcouples-wakes-up-man-in-apartment.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcouples-wakes-up-man-in-apartment.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kate-jackson-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kate-jackson-html.html>Kate Jackson - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./funke-akindele-has-been-unlucky-in-personal-life-but-she-is-dogged-kate-henshaw.html>'Funke Akindele Has Been Unlucky In Personal Life But She Is Dogged'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./funke-akindele-has-been-unlucky-in-personal-life-but-she-is-dogged-kate-henshaw.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
