As boys we grazed cows and goats...we hunted wild animals like rabbits. Growing up we didn't know if people were well off or poor, we were all equals. As a community, we built houses together and socilialised at village dances," he told Forbes Africa Magazine.<p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Nairobi woman says magic gave her powers to sleep with rich men, eat their money</p><p class=align-left>As a simple livestock herder, Mwangi learnt the concept of supply chain which propelled him to the man he now is.</p>"Taking milk to the village restaurant or selling fruits to the middleman who would later take them to Nairobi introduced me to the concept of supply chains. I realised I was the primary producer with my mother, the middleman dealt with logistics, and then an aggregator, who was our face in the marketplace, played on volume and made more money than anyone else," he said.<p class=align-left>The banker later horned these skills at the University of Nairobi after securing a scholarship owing to his academic talent.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Nathan Ake proposes to girlfriend shortly after agreeing move to Man City</p><p class=align-left>After completing his studies he began his career as an auditor at Ernst and Young and moved to the defunct Trade Bank Group, climbing up the ladder fast to become the group financial controller.</p><p class=align-left>His breakthrough, however, came in 1993 when Equity Building Society (EBS) founded in 1984 by Peter Munga as a mutual society was on its knees and had already been declared insolvent and facing dissolution.</p><p class=align-left>Munga who knew Mwangi as a boy turned to him to rescue the financial institution, which was on the verge of collapse.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Jubilee's vice chairman David Murathe's daughter June Tuto flaunts mzungu bae in cute photos</p>"I had developed the reputation of a brilliant boy since I was the first boy from my village to get a university degree. I had risen up to be a director at Trade Bank by the age of 28 and my bold decision making packaged me in the eyes of Munga and other EBS executives," he said.<p class=align-left>The then 31-year-old left was appointed the director strategy at EBS and had a hard task of restoring the debt-ridden society, which had not published accounts for three years.</p>"We didn't have the money..the currency that Equity was a passion to please the customer. I had a very small staff and none had gone beyond Form Four but they had enthusiasm," he narrated<p class=align-left>By ensuring the society's then 12,000 customers were accorded the dignity they deserved and with staff morale boosted, EBS picked up and by 1997 had managed to clear its debts.</p><p class=align-left>In August 2004, it transitioned to Equity Bank and was listed on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) two years later.</p><p class=align-left>In 2019, the lender re-branded again into Equity Group Holdings Ltd with branches and customers across the East African region.</p><p class=align-left>The bank currently has a market capitalisation of approximately KSh 128.1 billion mainly attributed to the "Mwangi model" which thrives on high volumes, low margins and mass market appeal.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
