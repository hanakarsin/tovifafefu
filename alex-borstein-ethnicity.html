And she's Hungarian. I mean, if you go back it's like Hungarian-Mongolian ... <strong></strong>My dad's side is Polish and Russian. And I don't you know, I don't speak any Polish. I don't speak any Russian. I don't have a huge connection with that side just because my mother was, you know, I was first generation."</p><p>"I felt just very Hungarian," she shared. "We had some Hebrew and my dad speaks Yiddish, as well my mom Hungarian, and there were so different languages in the house. My dad was raised Orthodox Jewish, my mom was very spiritual Jewish, having survived the Holocaust. I know a lot of people have a similar similar experience—their grandparents or their parents that survived are very spiritual and very Jewish that way, but not religious."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>"Step out of line, ladies!"</p><p>Damn, Alex Borstein.

"I was raised conservative Jewish. I went to a private Jewish Day School up until sixth grade and then, I still feel pretty Jewish. I mean, I love some of the traditions and the music and food, the challah. I don't go to temple, except for the High Holy days, but I do identify strongly as Jewish."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She also told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jewish Journal</a>, "My mother is a child survivor of the Holocaust. She was born in Budapest at the time when they were lining Jews up and shooting them into pits ... My grandmother gave my mother in her bassinet to a cousin, who was around 8 or 9, and the girl just walked out of line and kept walking. There were stories of holes in their shoes and lice in their hair, but they got out alive."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Alex lovingly noted in the same interview that Susie reminded her of her grandmother and her mother.</p><p>"My grandmother, a Holocaust survivor, was very funny, very dark and bi---y.
