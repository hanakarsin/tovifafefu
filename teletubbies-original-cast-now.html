The BBC-helmed children's show, which ran in its original incarnation from 1997â€“2001, became a pop-culture phenomenon that millions of young people have enjoyed throughout their childhoods. From their iconic appearances to their vibrant colors and happy mannerisms, Teletubbies embody everything that one could want in a lighthearted children's program.</p><p>Now that the very generation that grew up on Teletubbies is starting to enter the age where they have children of their own, <a href=#>Netflix</a> is blessing a whole new era of fans with a reboot of Teletubbies that's sure to once again bring about all the joy and wonder that it did more than 20 years ago.</p><p>Since we're taking a stroll down memory lane with this reboot, it's worth asking: Where is the original cast of Teletubbies today? Let's unpack what we know about the stars' career progression.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/WildBrain</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Where is the original 'Teletubbies' cast today?</h2><p>A lot has changed since the original Teletubbies aired on BBC, and yes, that includes the fact that one original actor is no longer alive. Here's what we know about where the cast members are today.</p><p>Po, the baby of the group, was played by actress Pui Fan Lee. In the years since Teletubbies went off the air, she has taken on quite a few other roles. These include being a CBeebies presenter as well as hosting another children's show called Show Me, Show Me, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@Realpuifanlee; Instagram/@howtospeakchild</span><p>Pui Fan Lee and Nikky Smedley</p></figure><p>Taking a look at Laa Laa, who was played by Nikky Smedley, we also see that she has gone on to do plenty in the time since Teletubbies ended. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>, Nikky, a trained dancer, has also hosted another children's show called Boohbah as well as lent her dancing abilities to the choreography of In The Night Garden.</p><p>When it comes to Tinky Winky, the story gets a bit sadder. The character was portrayed by Simon Shelton from 1997 onward after the original actor, Dave Thompson, was reportedly fired for implying Tinky Winky was gay. Simon became the known face behind the character for the show's duration. Unfortunately, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>, Simon struggled with alcoholism and was found dead at 52 years old in 2018 with the cause being deemed as hypothermia alongside a high concentration of alcohol in his blood.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@johnsimmit; Instagram/@emilyatackofficial</span><p>Simon Shelton and John Simmit</p></figure><p>Last but certainly not least, Dipsy, who was portrayed by John Simmit, has gone on to do great things.

Famous for starting off episodes of the children's show with an inquisitive and smiling baby's face emitting from the sun, the character became emblematic of the show. Nowadays, Jessica Smith, who portrayed the sun baby when she was... well, a baby, is still living her best life. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, she appears to be in a happy relationship and still actively discussing her child acting role.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbKtsdOumZuhlah6sL7IoKCnmZxisKK%2F02alqK8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fteletubbies-original-cast-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fteletubbies-original-cast-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fteletubbies-original-cast-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fteletubbies-original-cast-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fteletubbies-original-cast-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fteletubbies-original-cast-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./carolynn-rowland-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./carolynn-rowland-html.html>Carolynn Shada - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-bola-tinubu-discussed-with-shettima-apc-senators.html>What Bola Tinubu Discussed With Shettima, APC Senators</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./what-bola-tinubu-discussed-with-shettima-apc-senators.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
