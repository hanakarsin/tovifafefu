<time>21 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Wikeeeee-1000x600.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>The Rivers State Governor, <a href=# rel=noopener>Nyesom Wike</a> has knocked some Niger Delta Governors challenging him for speaking openly about the 13 percent derivation arrears paid by the Federal Government.</h2><p>Wike said instead of attacking him, they should just show their people what they have done with the money.</p><p>He added that he has done nothing wrong by appreciating <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>President Muhammadu Buhari</a></strong> for paying the money to them though he is not a fan of the President but the truth must be told at all times.</p><p>The Rivers State Governor who spoke on Friday while inaugurating the road to Rumuodogo communities in Emohua Local Government Area, said some of his critics spend as much as four years to execute one project but he doesn’t spend more than one and half years on any project.</p><p>Wike also challenged those using ‘unknown faces and groups’ to attack him to stop such and face him directly.</p><p>Wike said: “What is my crime today in the Niger Delta states? I said God thank President Buhari for giving me money to do this road. Did I commit any offence. I don’t know the offence that I committed for saying thank you.</p><p>“Let me tell those who are making noise. Whether you are a governor I don’t care. Whoever you are I don’t care. I came to run as a governor of Rivers. No governor said I want to put you as a governor. I came on my own. We defeated the sitting governor. Some governors were brought by their godfathers. I never had a godfather to bring me as a governor. The only godfather I had was God and the people of Rivers State.</p><p>“So, when some governors are talking they should know those they are talking with. We are not on the same level. We can’t be on the same level. Let these small people keep quiet. If you are not prepared for governance, give up. I am prepared for governance. I will prepare till I leave.</p><p>“I am not a fan of Buhari. I am not one of those who go to Abuja to see them. But the truth must be told. When somebody had done well in an aspect, you say so. No matter how you hate me, won’t you give me the credit that I did Rumuodogo road?</p><p>“Even if you don’t like Buhari and I say he released money I am using to do something, is anything wrong in that? Some people are not grateful in life, even when you help them they can never be grateful. I will continue to be grateful. People open their mouth and say three kilometre road in their state is more than how many flyovers in Rivers.</p><h2>Do It If You Can</h2><p>Wike challenged the Governors using the nature of the land in their states as an excuse to desist from such, saying Rivers State is also a riverine state but they achieve so much.</p><p>“Rivers is a Niger Delta state. It has riverine and land areas. I don’t know who can claim they are more riverine than Rivers State. I didn’t tell you to give account. All I say is thank Buhari. What I expected them to do is to join me and thank Buhari. Now they are saying we receive this and that. What’s my business. If you say you have more water do the ones you have water let us see.</p><p>“I have never done any project more than a year and half. I challenge anybody. I can tell you the contractors doing job in this state. Name the ones doing jobs in your state. Do your own, not to do one project for four years. I will never do any project for four years.</p><p>“People have been sending their people to insult me and I laugh. Some people they call them Akwa Ibom professionals. They were insulting me. I say tell the man who sent you to come out. We are not kids. I am waiting for you. Some people say Ijaw professionals, you sending them come out. It is you I am looking for. Not all these fries.</p><p>“That we are doing 12 flyovers, did I ask you not to do? I am not doing only roads. Go and see what we have done in the health sector. See what we are doing in Yenagoa Law School. We put over N5bn to recover that school in the South south. When they gave us a licence we built our own law school campus within 10 months.</p><p>“I challenge any state to commission projects in three weeks everyday. So, what are you talking about? I am not running an election. I don’t need to be a sycophant. But the truth must be told at all times. If you want to face Wike come and face me. I have the capacity and I have told them to be careful.</p><p>“I have never gone to a meeting with anybody in life and we agree on something and I abandon it. I am not a betrayer. It is not in my blood. Tell them to face their problems. We started inauguration on November 14. We will end tomorrow. By Monday we will start flagging off new projects. I will pepper them. The politics today is not to talk but operation show your report card.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze49rZq2gla56or7EZqSao5mjtG66zqKqnmWSqsFutYydpqesXZius7GMsKCknV2ouaK50mampKenlnqwwMeeqWammZyys3nDnqOtmV2cvLex0aemq6tf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthey-are-making-noise-but-i-dont-care-wike-slams-okowa-other-niger-delta-governors.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthey-are-making-noise-but-i-dont-care-wike-slams-okowa-other-niger-delta-governors.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthey-are-making-noise-but-i-dont-care-wike-slams-okowa-other-niger-delta-governors.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthey-are-making-noise-but-i-dont-care-wike-slams-okowa-other-niger-delta-governors.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthey-are-making-noise-but-i-dont-care-wike-slams-okowa-other-niger-delta-governors.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthey-are-making-noise-but-i-dont-care-wike-slams-okowa-other-niger-delta-governors.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./i-am-jazz-season-8.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./i-am-jazz-season-8.html>When Is the Premiere Date?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./277960-kwanza-ulipataje-vyeti-vya-elimu-na-hukusoma-odm-chamuuliza-echesa-html.html>Kwanza ulipataje vyeti vya elimu na hukusoma?
