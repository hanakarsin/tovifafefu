Apart from Wike, we rated some of the governors as “weak”.</p><p>“The weakness accounted for why the National Chairman of PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, decided to come out to challenge Governor Samuel Ortom.</p><p>“We said if key PDP leaders in each of the five states are engaged, Atiku can win about 50 percent of the votes in the five states.</p><p>“Besides Rivers State, the other states are not swing states in any way. They are parasitic states to Rivers.</p><p>“We know what is happening. One of the states has just been supplied brand new vehicles for the campaign by one of the five governors.</p><p>“The introduction of Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has buoyed the confidence of Atiku and PDP leaders that the five governors are beatable in their terrains.”</p><p>According to reports, Atiku and the PDP have shifted their focus to the North and are desperately trying to&nbsp;make inroads into some parts of the North despite the presidential candidate being a Northerner.</p><p>The opposition party is worried that most of the states in the North are under the control of the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>All Progressives Congress (APC)</a></strong>.</p><h2>Bauchi Strategy Meeting</h2><p>In line with Plan B, some PDP leaders including Ayu; Sokoto State Governor and Director-General of the PDP Presidential Campaign Council, Aminu Tambuwal, and former Governor of Jigawa State, <strong>Sule Lamido</strong> met with the Bauchi State Governor, <strong>Senator Bala Mohammed</strong> in Bauchi on Saturday.</p><p>A source said: “With the South-East gone, the South-South fluid and the South-West a no-go area for PDP, the alternative is to do everything possible to win in the North.</p><p>“They are desperate to secure the North or else the election will be a formality for APC.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49vZp%2BtnKF6pbHTmqClq12ks26t06KirmWRrsJuuM6ymKWho6nAbr%2FTq5itnZeuerW7jJ2cn52RqXqltdKgqZqblWLEqrfEZqarrJ%2Bieq6tyqKlnZ1dpMGpsdGsZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffull-details-of-atiku-ayu-loyalists-strategy-to-defeat-disgrace-wike-ortom-makinde-others.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffull-details-of-atiku-ayu-loyalists-strategy-to-defeat-disgrace-wike-ortom-makinde-others.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffull-details-of-atiku-ayu-loyalists-strategy-to-defeat-disgrace-wike-ortom-makinde-others.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffull-details-of-atiku-ayu-loyalists-strategy-to-defeat-disgrace-wike-ortom-makinde-others.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffull-details-of-atiku-ayu-loyalists-strategy-to-defeat-disgrace-wike-ortom-makinde-others.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffull-details-of-atiku-ayu-loyalists-strategy-to-defeat-disgrace-wike-ortom-makinde-others.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./latest-political-news-in-nigeria-for-today-wednesday-8th-june-2022.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./latest-political-news-in-nigeria-for-today-wednesday-8th-june-2022.html>Latest Political News In Nigeria For Today, Wednesday, 8th June, 2022</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./benue-2023-i-have-no-anointed-candidate-ortom.html>Benue 2023: I have No Anointed Candidate</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./benue-2023-i-have-no-anointed-candidate-ortom.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
