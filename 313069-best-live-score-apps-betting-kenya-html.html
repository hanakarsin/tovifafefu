<time>12 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p class=align-left><strong>Soccer, or as we commonly refer it in Kenya, football, is undeniably the most popular sport not only in the country but also the world. Millions of people love watching teams playing against each other anytime they are free. Nonetheless, some fixtures can be scheduled to take place during work hours. This is where live score apps are handy in keeping you updated on the latest results of any game you have already placed a bet. These apps are also vital for anyone who loves live betting. In spite of this, not all the football applications in the Google Play Store or App Store are the best live score apps.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/c677b545c769d471.jpeg><p class=align-left>It is not surprising that in this age of Smartphones and iPhones, we have football live score apps that keep anyone updated with anything ongoing in football matches of choice. If you are crazy about soccer and betting, then you deserve the right to be updated about any fixture that is currently ongoing when not near TV screens. Below are the best apps for goals alerts that update scores in real-time on your phone screen.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ce9de38f42d29df8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is SteamUnlocked?
