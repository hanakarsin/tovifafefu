<time>19 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1200x675/default.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><strong>The State Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Barrister Taofeek Gani in this interview with OLAOLU OLADIPO declares that the days of the All Progressive Congress (APC) are numbered in Lagos.</strong></p><p><strong>The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has released the election timetable, what is the reaction of the Lagos PDP to the document? . How prepare is your party?</strong></p><p>To us, the timetable as prevented by INEC is in tandem with the provisions of the electoral Act. It is a step in the right direction became the commission has been laid bare, the schedule of activities that will culminate in series of elections scheduled for next year.</p><p>All the political parties cannot say that they are not aware of the timetable as it has also given people and political parties the needed ample time to plan for the election. For instance, nobody will feign any ignorance of the period of campaign if or when he runs foul of the laws.</p><p>With the time table, everybody is now clear about when to start and end campaigns. It is also put the parties on their toes to plan to capture or retain power. Lagos PDP is very ready for the election.</p><p><strong>Really?</strong></p><p>At this point in time, we have no reason to be jittery about the possible outcome of the polls. Even, if the timetable had prescribed that elections hold to day in Lagos, we are confidence of victory. We are going to capitalize on the mistakes of the APC to snatch power from them. Their programmes and actions have become so offensive to the people of Lagos. At any point of time that INEC blast that whistle for the commencement of poll, I can assure you that we are ready.</p><p><strong>Your confidence seems to run contrary to the positon of the APC, who maintain that the people of the state will vote for them because of the performance of the current government.</strong></p><p>They are just being arrogant in their refusal to believe that they have failed the people of the state. When you sample the opinion of people in the state, I will say there is no amount of rigging that the APC will do this time that we will not counter, we are going to fight tooth and nail to protect our votes. They should begin to prepare their hand over note as Lagosians, are going to reject them. We are already, the government in waiting. In the past, the outcome could be said to be predictable but let me say that the same parameters that they (APC members) have set in measuring the PDP at the centre will also used against them. Those people who used to assist them to win in the past have deserted them now. I mean the market people, the Okada riders and the Market women we are confidence that all the indices are now in our favour.</p><p><strong>How well has your party ensure reconciliation amongst members considering the fact that PDP in Lagos is crisis prone?</strong></p><p>To God be the glory. I can tell you that many gladiators in the PDP who were pitched against one another and now on talking terms. What the press may not have seen is the public show of same. This is also strategic because as a party we maybe not like spreading our clothes outside what we know now is that we are better off, we are better united now unlike before. The result of the election will confirm that.</p><p><strong>APC members have always accused your party at the centre of non-performance…don’t you think that will impact negatively on your party?</strong></p><p>Ask the people of the state to compare the benefit they enjoy from both the state and federal Government owned institutions. Compare the amount every student in LASU pay to what students in UNILAG people pay. Most of the bridges connecting both ends of the state are constructed by the federal Government, the one done by the state government which is less than a kilometer is heavily tolled. I can go on and on. The Federal Government owned medical centres are cheaper compared to those owned by the state government like LASUTH. Today, the average civil servant in Lagos is not happy because they are not being paid the minimum wage. If they are going to use Lagos State as their model, they are going to be worse off.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgnaElWxloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f55863-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f55863-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f55863-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f55863-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f55863-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f55863-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./269131-jkuat-diploma-courses-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./269131-jkuat-diploma-courses-html.html>Diploma courses offered at JKUAT</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sanam-puri-html.html>Sanam Puri - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sanam-puri-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
