Four years ago, my rent was $1,200 a month at a luxury apartment complex. It is now $2,100 not even including utilities! I went to the grocery store yesterday, right? And got three bags of chips, some ground turkey, and some vegetables. And it was $67!"</p><p>He continued to scream into the camera: "What?! My car insurance from four years ago until now with no tickets, no wrecks...nothing on my driver's record has gone from $130 to $240 per month! Three years ago my electric bill was averaging $45 now it's averaging $125! You go and get a tank of gas once a week and you're dropping $70!"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@itstrevorabney href=#>@itstrevorabney</a> <a title="♬ original sound - Trevor Abney" href=#>♬ original sound - Trevor Abney</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @itstrevorabney</span></figure><p>"I mean a guy can't even buy a can of dip for less than $8. $8 for a can of dip?! What the f--- is going on!" he asked into the camera.</p><p>Trevor isn't the only person who's ranted on social media against the abysmal state of global inflation that families across the world are struggling with.</p><p>The US inflation rate hit a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">40-year-high in June of 2022</a>, and the cost of living expenses in the. Countless Americans have been complaining on social media about the lack of affordable housing, and their concern is backed up by data: it was officially easier in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Great Depression than it is today for the average American to purchase a home</a>.</p><p>The worst part is that workers' salaries, unfortunately, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">aren't keeping up with the rate of inflation</a>, they say, leaving many Americans in the lurch when it comes to affording basic necessities such as utilities, rent/mortgages, and food.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @itstrevorabney</span></figure><p>In an October, 2023 piece published by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barron's</a>, 65% of Americans say that they are living paycheck to paycheck. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bankrate</a> also wrote that 22% of folks in the country have zero emergency savings whatsoever, leaving folks scrambling for new employment opportunities the second they are laid off.</p><p>What's even more troubling is the number of Americans who are working side hustles in order to make ends meet or have any type of savings at all. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a> writes that 44% of employees have taken additional jobs to keep up with the worsening economy and the US government's failure to stabilize it.</p><p>So why is inflation becoming such a big problem? Some argue that the tomfoolery occurring with the economy at this juncture is a concentrated effort by the government-powers-that-be to get penalize <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Americans for the stimulus checks</a> they received from their own tax dollars.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @itstrevorabney</span></figure><p>Suspicions of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Bank caught in yet another purported scandal aside</a>, there are outlets who've <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">questioned the efficacy of Stimulus money/checks in general</a>, with some, like ABC News asking if the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">government's decision to hand them out were a mistake in the first place</a>.</p><p>However, it does appear that some of the onus of<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> America's current inflation rate is being blamed, at least partially, on the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, and the government's decision to implement stay-at-home and social distancing mandates (the latter of which <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Anthony Fauci admitted on the record wasn't based in any factual scientific data</a>) in response to the fervor fomented around the disease.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo! did write that while the Fed</a> did say stimulus checks may've worsened inflation, that the problem could've been a lot worse had they not been issued, putting Americans in a real catch .22.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @itstrevorabney</span></figure><p>Commenters who responded to Trevor's video seem to sympathize with his anger, with multiple people remarking how their money just didn't seem to go as far these days.</p><p>"Wages don’t keep up with inflation," one person wrote.</p><p>"$20 is the new $5," someone else said, while another wrote: "$1000 is the new 100$."</p><p>One person also commented on the inequity of salary increases in the wake of inflation hikes: "And we got a $.50 pay increase to help with inflation"</p><p>Overall, it didn't seem like folks had much faith in the Government's ability to stabilize or manage the economy, either: "Don’t worry the government says inflation is only at 4% not 200% so we’re good"</p><p>How are things going for you? Do you feel like things are getting prohibitively expensive?
