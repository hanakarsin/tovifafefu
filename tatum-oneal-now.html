"She also had a cardiac arrest and a number of seizures. There were times we didn't think she was going to survive."</p><p style=text-align:start>If she did survive, Kevin and his siblings feared that Tatum may never be able to walk or talk again.</p><p style=text-align:start>Tatum has struggled with addiction for decades, and has recently been in rehab facilities designed to help her re-learn basic skills like reading.</p><p>At the time, Tatum was abusing prescription drugs that were prescribed for her neck and back pain and for rheumatoid arthritis. In of May 2020, she overdosed on a combination of those pills, morphine, and opiates. The few years prior to that incident had been difficult, and the feelings of isolation that she was feeling only worsened when the isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic set in.</p><p>"At times, it was touch and go,” Kevin explained. “I had to call my brother and sister and say she was thought to be blind, deaf, and potentially might never speak again."</p><p>In the years since, Tatum has been in a prolonged recovery program and has made slow but steady progress.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Tatum Beatrice Oneal (@tatum__oneal)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">How is Tatum's health now?</h2><p>Although Tatum has recovered substantially since 2020, and has worked during that time to regain her full memory, she and her children have acknowledged that there's still a lot of work left to be done.</p><p>“Emotionally the things that made my mom want to take drugs in the first place, those things are still very present," Kevin explained.</p><p>"She has embraced this attempt at recovery," he added. "She was always a very loving mom but when isolated, I think it was hard to find any love for herself.”</p><p>For her part, Tatum is attending 12-step meetings and seems to understand that her struggles with addiction were always going to be a lifelong battle. “I’ve been trying to get sober my whole life,” says O’Neal. “Every day, I am trying.”</p><p>Thankfully, Tatum is still able to wake up every day and try. Our prayers are with Tatum and her family as she works to keep recovering and maintain her sobriety.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqa61wcxmpqedkaF6r7vW</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftatum-oneal-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftatum-oneal-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftatum-oneal-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftatum-oneal-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftatum-oneal-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftatum-oneal-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./earlan-bartley-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./earlan-bartley-html.html>Earlan Bartley - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./65817-html.html>UK Ready To Help Nigeria On GGSS Chibok Abducted Female Students</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./65817-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
