That's part of the reason so many people were worried after they saw him using a cane during the Oct. 31 broadcast.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why does Terry Bradshaw have a cane?</h2><p>During the Halloween Fox NFL Sunday broadcast, <a href=#>Terry Bradshaw</a> made an appearance to discuss the stigmas surrounding mental health, especially among professional athletes. During the segment, fans noticed that Terry was using a cane that he'd never been seen with before. Terry was also absent from the Oct. 24 broadcast, as well as the Thursday night game on Oct. 28.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p><a href=#>Terry</a> wasn't a part of those broadcasts because he was recovering from knee surgery, and that likely explains why he was using a cane during the Oct. 31 broadcast as well. Terry has been known for making wild proclamations during broadcasts, and while fans don't often agree with his analysis, many were likely happy to know that he would be able to ditch the cane once his recovery is complete.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Terry faced criticism for some of his football analysis.</h2><p>In addition to his cane, Terry was trending yesterday for a take he made at the beginning of the month. He claimed that the Panthers had found the best quarterback in their franchise's history in Sam Darnold, who has played incredibly poorly in the weeks since Terry made that claim. Even before Sam's play began to decline, many felt that Terry's take was wrong.</p><p>After all, the Panthers once had Cam Newton, who won a league MVP award and also took the team to a Super Bowl. Many also argued that Jake Denholmme, who also took the team to a Super Bowl, also deserved an apology. Terry's take on the Panthers' quarterback may have been an obvious error, but it's not one that fans are willing to let him forget about.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This Sam Darnold take is aging like milk. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0lM55CCbDe</a></p>— ⚛ Winning Culture ⚛ (@BigCheeseTC) <a href=#>October 24, 2021</a></figure><p>"Terry Bradshaw owes Cam Newton and maybe even freaking Jake Delhomme apologies. Lol," one person wrote on Twitter.</p><p>"Terry Bradshaw deserves to go one on one with the undertaker in hell in a cell for the way he disrespected Cam," another added.</p><p>Although many people may be wondering about Terry's health, there are plenty who are just annoyed about the ways he's proven to be incorrect in recent weeks.</p><p>Of course, part of the fun of NFL broadcasters is that they say things that often prove to be totally incorrect. When they ultimately prove to be wrong, though, they can get dunked on by the internet. It's all part of the game, and Terry has been a great personality on TVs for more than 25 years. Thankfully, it seems like he's ready to continue broadcasting, even if he has to do it with a cane for a little while.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxlkqeupb%2FHmq5moJGrsm6tjJyYp50%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-does-bradshaw-have-a-cane.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-does-bradshaw-have-a-cane.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-does-bradshaw-have-a-cane.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-does-bradshaw-have-a-cane.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-does-bradshaw-have-a-cane.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-does-bradshaw-have-a-cane.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lee-marvin-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lee-marvin-html.html>Lee Marvin - Trivia, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tension-as-buharis-ministers-others-miss-apc-resignation-deadlines.html>Tension As Buharis Ministers, Others Miss APC Resignation Deadlines</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tension-as-buharis-ministers-others-miss-apc-resignation-deadlines.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
