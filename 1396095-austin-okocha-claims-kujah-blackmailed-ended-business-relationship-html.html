Friday Kujah called me one early morning on phone to suggest that he and one Israelis had a business idea. He said he wants us to start a Bureau de change business. He brought the Israelis from a Mega Plaza.“I asked both of them how much they would contribute for the business to commence, but they replied that they don’t have any money. I would only pay them percentage based on money generated. Thereafter, he (Kujah) told me to send $300,000, which I did. He went and registered the company in his name.“The business was not yielding any positive result, rather, they kept asking me for more money. When I returned from Qatar, Friday Kujah couldn’t render anything in terms of profit from the business. Things were going from bad to worse. They took loan from the bank, yet they couldn’t pay for the house rent, and debts were pilling up. It got to a stage the owner of the building could not take it. He took us to the Economic & Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), and I had to settle the debt.“One day, the Israelis, who was the Operations Manager, walked up to me to say that I had to give them another $1million for the business to survive. I was sensing great danger ahead. When it became clear that my business with Friday Kujah was not heading any good direction, I left him and registered my company, Jay Jay Okocha Bureau de change. So, in what way have I shortchanged or owe Friday Kujah money? He is going about scandalising my name, and reporting me to EFCC, but I won’t join issues with him. As I said, I won’t succumb to his cheap blackmail."<p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Become a member of the leading sports Facebook group 'Naija Football Fan Zone'</a></p><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, <strong>Legit.ng</strong> had earlier reported that Austin Okocha <a href=#>has scored under fire Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr high</a> in his four-year spell with the national team.</p><p class=align-left>The former Nigerian international claimed that he would score the Franco-German tactician seven out of ten despite his poor strings of results with the three-time African champions.</p><p class=align-left>Rohr's side gave up a four-goal cushion against Sierra-leone in an AFCON 2021 qualifier and failed to win in the second leg at Freetown.</p><p class=align-left><strong>3 interesting footballing moments between Maradona and Nigeria</strong> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Legit TV</a></p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnSFlWlwbmWRqsC1tc1mpqSnk52ubq%2FLmqCmq12gwqutx2aZpZmToLqitcuem2adnpmypXnBrqqippWowG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9nn62lnA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f1396095-austin-okocha-claims-kujah-blackmailed-ended-business-relationship-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f1396095-austin-okocha-claims-kujah-blackmailed-ended-business-relationship-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f1396095-austin-okocha-claims-kujah-blackmailed-ended-business-relationship-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f1396095-austin-okocha-claims-kujah-blackmailed-ended-business-relationship-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f1396095-austin-okocha-claims-kujah-blackmailed-ended-business-relationship-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f1396095-austin-okocha-claims-kujah-blackmailed-ended-business-relationship-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1543018-makeup-artist-recounts-how-bride-scammed-regular-glam-her-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1543018-makeup-artist-recounts-how-bride-scammed-regular-glam-her-html.html>Makeup Artist Recounts How Bride 'Scammed' Her into Doing Regular Glam Look For Her</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./best-pumpkin-patch-near-me.html>The Best Pumpkin Patches Near Me Here's Where You Need to Go</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./best-pumpkin-patch-near-me.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
