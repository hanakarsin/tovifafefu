According to Reesa, Legion lied about how much money he had in the bank, his career, and even how many times he was married.</p><p>Within days, a TikTok sleuth named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Danni (@dannih_19)</a> revealed on her account that “Legion’s” real name is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerome David McCoy</a>. Additionally, one of Jerome’s ex-wives, LaToya Averett, whom Reesa mentioned in her TikToks, told her side of the story on the app, along with Jerome’s ex-stepson.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@reesamteesa</a><p>Reesa Teesa discussing her ex-husband, Jerome McCoy</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Who is Jerome McCoy’s ex-wife?</h2><p>As Reesa explained on TikTok, she and Jerome met in March 2020. In January 2021, the pair were married, and Reesa said things between them worsened quickly.</p><p>During their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">six-month union</a>, Reesa allegedly discovered several unsettling details about her ex-husband, including how he lied about his grandmother dying of COVID (she passed in 2008), how he didn’t have any sisters as he had led her to believe, and that he lied about his “first wife’s” daughter dying of COVID, which allegedly prompted him to send his ex $2,000.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@reesamteesa href=#>@reesamteesa</a><p>Just a small snippet of the things my ex husband lied about. <a title=pathologicalliar href=#>#pathologicalliar</a> <a title=divorcetok href=#>#divorcetok</a> <a title=covid href=#>#covid</a> <a title=reesateesa href=#>#reesateesa</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - ReesaTeesa" href=#>♬ original sound - ReesaTeesa</a></figure><p>After being fed up with her husband’s lies, Reesa looked into his background. In addition to finding out that his ex’s daughter was alive and well following a phone conversation with the woman, she searched for his grandmother’s obituary. On the obituary, Reesa learned Jerome had been married to another woman outside the ex she knew about. The woman’s name, according to the document, was LaToya.</p><p>Reesa discovered that LaToya and Jerome were together until 2015 and lived in Rhode Island during their relationship, something he never disclosed to Reesa. She also saw that, unlike Jerome’s real second wife, Jerome filed to divorce LaToya, which we can confirm is true, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Clayton County, Georgia’s divorce records</a>. Reesa also said Jerome and LaToya had restraining orders against one another during their split.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">LaToya Averett addressed her and Jerome’s divorce on TikTok.</h2><p>Court records show Jerome filed for divorce on Dec. 8, 2017. He and LaToya finalized the divorce on Feb. 28, 2018, and have seemingly had no contact with each other since. As Reesa said about the divorce that she knew about, records indicate Jerome requested a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“pauper’s affidavit”</a> for the divorce due to lack of funds.</p><p>Amid the unwanted attention she received from Reesa’s “Who TF Did I Marry” story, LaToya felt compelled to speak out about her “past life” once and for all.</p><p>In her 7:32 TikTok, LaToya confirmed she and Jerome were married and hadn’t been in contact in nearly a decade. She also agreed with Reesa’s allegations that Jerome is “manipulative” and said her ex “tried to ruin my life.”</p><p>“He had family turn against me because he wanted to tell people lies about me and things of that nature,” LaToya said. “And unfortunately, he's very, very good at what he does. It took me many, many, many years to get past that.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@mz.nzuri href=#>@mz.nzuri</a><p><a title=latoyafirstwife href=#>#latoyafirstwife</a> <a title=legion href=#>#legion</a> <a title=reesateesa href=#>#reesateesa</a> <a title=healing href=#>#healing</a> <a title=painintopurpose href=#>#painintopurpose</a> <a title=myhealthmymindandbodyradioshow href=#>#myhealthmymindandbodyradioshow</a> freeconferencecall.com/wall/djShaun tune in tonight at 9pm est.</p><a title="♬ original sound - Mz.

LaToya described Jerome as a “pathological liar” who needed to be “locked away” and revealed he had been arrested for a heinous crime before their split.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@msdiamondlink href=#>@msdiamondlink</a><p><a title=reesateesa href=#>#reesateesa</a><a title=legion href=#>#legion</a><a title=whotfdidimarry href=#>#whotfdidimarry</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Sierra" href=#>♬ original sound - Sierra</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Jerome McCoy was arrested for impersonating a police officer in 2015.</h2><p>Reesa alluded to Jerome’s checkered past in her TikTok series. However, she didn’t delve into several of his arrests, including the one in October 2015 when he was arrested in Clayton County for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“impersonating a police officer.”</a> Jerome’s case states that bail was set for $8,000, and was later given a warrantless charge.</p><p>Six months after his arrest for impersonating an Atlanta police officer, Jerome was arrested again for “criminal trespassing.” Around the same time, he had LaToya’s son, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tashawn Lopes</a>, arrested following a dispute.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@tashawnlopes href=#>@tashawnlopes</a><p><a title=legion href=#>#LEGION</a> <a title=whodidimarry href=#>#whodidimarry</a> <a title=jeromemccoy href=#>#JeromeMcCoy</a> <a title=viral href=#>#Viral</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - tashawnlopes" href=#>♬ original sound - tashawnlopes</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Jerome McCoy’s stepson said Reesa Teesa is “100 percent telling the truth” in her “Who TF Did I Marry?” TikTok.</h2><p>In addition to Jerome’s ex-wife LaToya speaking out about her experiences with him, her son, Tashawn, shared his side of the story via TikTok. Tashawn said in his initial video that, as his mother stated, Jerome was arrested for impersonating a police officer. He also said Jerome had him arrested for “putting his hands on him” after Jerome allegedly threatened LaToya in front of him.</p><p>Tashawn shared that Jerome called Clayton County’s police on him, leading to his arrest. Clayton County’s records state Jerome was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">arrested on four counts</a> on July 6, 2015: “Battery-Family Violence, Battery, Simple Battery-Family Violence, and Simple Battery.” In August 2015, Tashawn pleaded not guilty to the charges, and in October 2015, the case was ruled “Nolle Prossed,” or “to be unwilling to prosecute.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@tashawnlopes href=#>@tashawnlopes</a><p><a title=legion href=#>#LEGION</a> <a title=whodidimarry href=#>#whodidimarry</a> <a title=jeromemccoy href=#>#JeromeMcCoy</a> <a title=viral href=#>#Viral</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - tashawnlopes" href=#>♬ original sound - tashawnlopes</a></figure><p>Tashawn stated in his video that everything Reesa accused Jerome of is “100 percent true.” He’s also gone live on TikTok several times to discuss his issues with Jerome in more detail.</p><p>Jerome, for his part, has only <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">denied Reesa’s claims publicly</a>. Amid the chaos, he released a video accusing Reesa of lying and said the “real reason I left you” was because Reesa allegedly cheated on him, which she denied in her posts.</p><p>It’s safe to say this cautionary tale will certainly continue online!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7Kzu8yeZKabk6TGbrHXZq6inpViuaLAzrKYZq%2BYpHq1soydoJ1lmWK6or7Rsg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjerome-mccoy-ex-wife-latoya-who-tf-did-i-marry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjerome-mccoy-ex-wife-latoya-who-tf-did-i-marry.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjerome-mccoy-ex-wife-latoya-who-tf-did-i-marry.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjerome-mccoy-ex-wife-latoya-who-tf-did-i-marry.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjerome-mccoy-ex-wife-latoya-who-tf-did-i-marry.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjerome-mccoy-ex-wife-latoya-who-tf-did-i-marry.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./alexander-lincoln-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./alexander-lincoln-html.html>Alexander Lincoln - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sidney-fullmer-html.html>Sidney Fullmer - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sidney-fullmer-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
