Honored to stand with @Janefonda and so many inspiring youth climate activists. More than 2 million Americans lack running water or a flush toilet--which most people take for granted. Race is the leading factor determining water access: African-American and Latinx families are 2x more likely than white families to lack water access, and Native Americans are 19x more likely The burden of the water crisis falls disproportionately upon women and girls. There are some community-led efforts to solve the US water access crisis in our lifetimes, like the Navajo Water Project, an Indigenous-led program led by phenomenal Indigenous women!

This mass action was a part of @firedrillfriday , led by @janefonda , who was inspired by the words of @gretathunberg as she called for all of us to act as if our house was on fire because in reality, it is. The truth is, we have a quickly closing gap to hugely transform our economy and our social structures to avoid irreversible climate catastrophe. I firmly believe that the #GreenNewDeal has the most potential that I have seen to fix this (as far as large-scale policy shifts go), while simultaneously creating big shifts towards racial, gender, and economic justice. I come to this work rooted in my practice of anti-racism and feminism, with the recognition that Indigenous, Black, and Brown people (both in the U.S. and in the Global South and elsewhere) are the hardest hit by all of the effects of climate change (look at Flint, Standing Rock, etc), with MANY poor white people being hugely affected as well. And that this damage is mostly caused by big corporations who operate with a colonialist mindset of profit at all costs. The issues are all linked, and so the solutions must be as well. # Was proud to be in community with my partner at @weinspirejustice , @jlovecalderon , who also put her body on the line and got arrested. And appreciation for everyone who showed up, including those not listed here! @gloriasteinem @revdrbarber @aijenp @annie_leonard @doloreshuerta @rosannaarquette @eveensler @lauraflanders @caseyrosewilson # There’s much more to say and to learn.
