So much so that free-lunch and snack programs are being cut&nbsp;because, well, I guess these kids' parents should just make more money to give them food and teach them about proper nutrition. Never mind the fact that many students from low-income areas rely on these meals as the primary source of their nutrition. Never mind the fact that when I worked in the school system, I had kids confess to me that they kind of dreaded the weekends and school breaks because they didn't know how they were going to get their next meals.</p><p>Despite the fact that the US could totally afford it, school districts are being forced to become more and more strict with enforcing their lunch payment policies, so they've developed some pretty creative ways to make sure kids aren't getting grub. For example, swipe cards with account balances, or not allowing kids to have hot lunches unless their payments are up-to-date. This leads to an upsetting reality: if you're unfortunate enough to be low-income and in public school, you could very well be "lunch-shamed."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">But this school's lunchroom-shaming tactic caused a ton of outrage online as kids with low balances are being physically marked.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is the stamp. On his wrist. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/I0OCK8VeBa</a></p>— TECHNOprah (@juanyfbaby) <a href=#>April 1, 2017</a></figure><p>Tara Chavez spoke about the incident in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BuzzFeed</a>. She recounted how her son came home one day with the mark on his wrist. He didn't bring it up until she asked him about it, and that's when he described why the lunch lady had grabbed his hand and stamped it. His lunch account was low and instead of sending a notice home or contacting his mother, the school implemented a policy where children were branded for not keeping their accounts up to date.</p><p>"My kid's really weird about stuff like that, so I asked if he was given a choice by the lunch lady and he said, 'No, she just grabbed my wrist and put the stamp on. I was surprised. Normally I get a slip in his folder when he needs more money."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Tara's friend posted a photo of the embarrassing stamp online, and the outrage was immediate.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@juanyfbaby</a> That's not remotely OK</p>— 💚💙dawn💙💚 (@SuperWhoDawn) <a href=#>April 1, 2017</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@juanyfbaby</a> <a href=#>@_b_e_n_c_</a> HOW MUCH DOES A CUSTOM STAMP COST</p><p>buy some lunches fucc this got me heated</p>— Ryan 🌹 (@HaverOfOpinions) <a href=#>April 1, 2017</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@juanyfbaby</a> SHAME on the school.

The principal responded, saying that staff is supposed to ask children whether or not they want a take-home slip or a stamp, so as not to embarrass the kids. Tara went on to say that she wants her son's school to recognize the impact this kind of branding could have on children.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@juanyfbaby</a> This is abuse. What the hell?! Branding a child - doesn't matter if it's ink - for money is unacceptable.</p>— Elly Queen (@EllyQueue) <a href=#>April 1, 2017</a></figure><p>And as someone who grew up poor, I have to agree. Going to school and not having the same nice clothes or cool snacks as the other kids really upset me. So much that when my family finally started to get a little bit of money, we went crazy and blew it all on all the stuff other kids had.&nbsp;</p><p>If it was a cute little stamp, or they turned it into a game, that's one thing. But you don't have to remind my 7-year-old ass that my parents are broke, why the hell do you think I walk around pretending I'm Nightcrawler from the X-Men during recess?</p><p>Imagine if banks started doing that to adults when their account balance is low? Insane, right? So why is it cool to do this to kids?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">More from Distractify&nbsp;</h2><p><a href=#><u>25 Extreme Cheapskates Who Tried to Cheat People and Got Destroyed&nbsp;</u></a></p><p><a href=#><u>People Are Sharing Times They Experienced a “Glitch in the Matrix”</u></a></p><p><a href=#><u>PETA Is Getting Roasted by This Seafood Restaurant</u></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKyimrultc2gZmtoYWx8cYCOaWtoaYl3nLOYjqyaoaefoXqtwc2cn2aln6OyunnTmqus</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fschool-lunch-money-tats.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fschool-lunch-money-tats.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fschool-lunch-money-tats.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fschool-lunch-money-tats.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fschool-lunch-money-tats.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fschool-lunch-money-tats.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./castlevania-season-5.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./castlevania-season-5.html>'Castlevania' Is Ending but the Universe Could Live on in a Spinoff</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./modric-set-to-win-nations-league-for-croatia-against-spain.html>Modric Set To Win Nations League For Croatia Against Spain</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./modric-set-to-win-nations-league-for-croatia-against-spain.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
