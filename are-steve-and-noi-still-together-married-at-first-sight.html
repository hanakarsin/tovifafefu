They have chemistry right off the bat, which can sometimes be hard for the couples so soon after they say, "I do."</p><p>That doesn't mean Noi and Steve are destined to be together forever. However, it does bode well for their future.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lifetime</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Steve and Noi still together after 'Married at First Sight'?</h2><p>Although there aren't any confirmed Married at First Sight spoilers for Season 14, Steve and Noi do seem like a solid match. There's even a scene in the season preview that shows Steve admitting he's in love with Noi. Her response is to throw her arms around his neck and kiss him.</p><p>It is, in a word, adorable. By all accounts, they seem like one of the more well-matched couples.</p><p>Noi told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicki Swift</a> in an interview that she was looking for someone who is "fun, successful, adventurous, generous, [and] kind" when she went into the experiment. Steve certainly ticks off most of those boxes, as he is a world traveler who proved during their wedding that he is a genuine person. The only issue fans see is Steve's job.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I KNEW Noi would be open minded about Steve No Jobâ€™s lack of a job. I just wished she wouldâ€™ve followed up by asking him what his plans were for going back to work?

He works freelance and it suits his lifestyle. However, with a new wife who wants to start having kids as soon as possible, traveling and refraining from laying down roots isn't the best idea. It may be the biggest hurdle Noi and Steve face, even if they do have potential.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Some 'MAFS' fans worry about Steve's stability.</h2><p>There are plenty of MAFS fans who are rooting for Noi and Steve because of their almost instant connection. One fan wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>, "Best couple and chemistry we've seen in many seasons. Seems organic, not fake, not forced. Which probably means somehow it will end up in disaster. Here's hoping."</p><p>However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another fan</a> wrote, "This guy jumped into a marriage right after his road trip, without a job. Just wondering about his motivation to take on a wife so soon."</p><p>As much as viewers love this pairing, some can't help but worry how finances and Steve's lack of a steady job will play into their future once they really sit down and talk about it. It's possible that Steve will have things figured out long-term.</p><p>But if he doesn't, then he and Noi have a lot to talk about well before they get to Decision Day.</p><p>Watch Married at First Sight on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST on Lifetime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2BmedKtnK%2BdXZa7pXnNqKBmq6Seua1506ienqyYmr9uucCrqaKdlGKutXnFoqmsrF2otqi00w%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-steve-and-noi-still-together-married-at-first-sight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fare-steve-and-noi-still-together-married-at-first-sight.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fare-steve-and-noi-still-together-married-at-first-sight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fare-steve-and-noi-still-together-married-at-first-sight.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-steve-and-noi-still-together-married-at-first-sight.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-steve-and-noi-still-together-married-at-first-sight.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nier-automata-anime-release-date.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nier-automata-anime-release-date.html>What's the Release Date for the Anime Adaptation of 'Nier: Automata'?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-eniola-badmus-went-from-a-sugar-mummy-to-side-chick.html>How Eniola Badmus Went From A Sugar Mummy To Side Chick</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-eniola-badmus-went-from-a-sugar-mummy-to-side-chick.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
