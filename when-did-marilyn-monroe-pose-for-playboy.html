Just how did he begin his massive empire? The media mogul launched his magazine in 1953 with a very recognizable face on its cover: <a href=#>Marilyn Monroe</a>'s.</p><p>So, when did Marilyn Monroe pose for Playboy? Did she willingly? It's a curious story.

Back then, the price tag was 50 cents, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Biography</a>, which notes that a gorgeous black-and-white smiling photograph of Marilyn Monroe atop an elephant graced its cover.</p><p>If you were to ask Hugh Hefner, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! Online</a> once did, the businessman described Marilyn Monroe as the "very first playmate of the month, very first cover." She "kind of set the standard," according to him, as the "Sweetheart of the Month." But Marilyn, who appeared on both the cover and nude in the magazine's "first-ever centerfold," never actually posed for the issue.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In fact, though the issue appeared three years after Marilyn's film career began to take flight, the photos were taken in 1949 when she was a struggling actress in need of cash. "In 1949, she posed nude for photographer Tom Kelley in exchange for $50," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a> writes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The photographer then sold his photographs to the calendar company Western Lithograph, which is how Hugh Hefner obtained them. In other words, Marilyn Monroe was never asked nor informed about the sale or publication. And most shockingly, the Some Like It Hot star was never paid more than the initial 50 bucks she initially made for posing for the photos.</p><p>"The picture was something that had been shot before," Hugh admitted to E! Online. "It was a calendar photo shot by Tom Kelley. Most people had heard about it but almost nobody had seen it and nobody had seen it because the post office had taken the position that you couldn't send nudity through the mail. And I'm the kid that didn't think the post office had that right."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"So we published that picture and it caused a sensation," he continued. Marilyn was left so in the dark about her cover appearance in the debut Playboy issue that even she had to "buy a copy of the magazine to see myself in it," she once revealed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As anyone who's heard of Playboy might guess, Marilyn's inclusion in the issue caused the magazine to become an instant success, and luckily, never negatively impacted the actress's career. While the two, at that point, had never even met in person, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Independent </a>writes that they eventually went on to have "a very close relationship."</p><p>Their relationship was so close and their legacies so intricately connected that when Hugh died in 2017, he was buried in a plot next to Marilyn's in Los Angeles's Westwood Village cemetery. This was no coincidence: the Playboy editor-in-chief secured his crypt in 1992 for $75,000.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmuoydoJ1lnZa%2FqrjYp2Smp56nvKZ5z6iqnmWWpL9uvMuasJunqQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhen-did-marilyn-monroe-pose-for-playboy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhen-did-marilyn-monroe-pose-for-playboy.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhen-did-marilyn-monroe-pose-for-playboy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhen-did-marilyn-monroe-pose-for-playboy.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhen-did-marilyn-monroe-pose-for-playboy.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhen-did-marilyn-monroe-pose-for-playboy.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./2023-tinubu-does-not-have-my-support-president-buharis-aide.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./2023-tinubu-does-not-have-my-support-president-buharis-aide.html>2023: Tinubu Does Not Have My Support</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./alice-klomp-html.html>pineapplebrat - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./alice-klomp-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
