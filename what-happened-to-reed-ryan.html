The athletic training team immediately administered CPR and regained the defensive lineman's pulse.</p><p>Reed was rushed to St. Mary's Medical Center in Duluth, Minn., where the ICU staff was "amazing in doing everything possible for him." A week later, on Nov. 28, 2023, Reed sadly passed away at the age of 22.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>UMD Bulldog Family, College Football Community Mourns the Passing of Reed Ryan</p><p>Story: <a href=#>https://t.co/NS7J6zPkUN</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rjrZRkxlKF</a></p>— UMD Athletics (@UMDBulldogs) <a href=#>November 29, 2023</a></figure><p>"Reed had a contagious smile and lived life to the fullest in his short years. Reed loved people, he could talk to anyone and prided himself on being surrounded by friends, family, mentors, and being part of a team," the obituary read.</p><p>He is survived by his parents, sister, brother, two nephews, grandmother, great-aunt, two uncles, and dog Sconnie. He was also an organ donor, donating many to help others after he died. He will also be "an important part of an NCAA research study to help prevent this from happening to other athletes," his family revealed in the obituary.</p><p>"Our staff and players are devastated about Reed's passing," UMD Bulldogs head football coach Curt Wiese said in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>. "Reed aspired to be better every day at whatever task was at hand. He helped bring out the best in others with his positive attitude, infectious smile, and genuine care for the people around him."</p><p>Curt continued, "We were fortunate to have Reed on our team, and he made our program, our department, and our community a better place in a short period of time. Reed will be greatly missed, but his legacy will live on forever. He was the epitome of a UMD Bulldog, and what we can all aspire to be."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>“You’ll never have a better person, & that’s what we got with Reed.

It's important to note that sudden cardiac arrest stands as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">leading cause of death among young athletes</a>.</p><p>Notably, LeBron James' teenage son, Bronny, <a href=#>experienced the same incident</a> during a team workout in July 2023.

Ryan also wrestled for his high school team, accumulating more than 100 wins.</p><p>After high school, Reed played football for four seasons at North Dakota State University before transferring to UMD in 2023. This season, he recorded seven tackles and aided another eight tackles in nine games.</p><p>Our thoughts are with Reed's family and friends during this difficult time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSrnZWZerPFwKc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-reed-ryan.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-reed-ryan.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-reed-ryan.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-reed-ryan.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-reed-ryan.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-reed-ryan.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./307748-jkuat-student-shot-trespassing-state-house-by-god-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./307748-jkuat-student-shot-trespassing-state-house-by-god-html.html>JKUAT student shot for trespassing on State House said he was sent by God</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./beau-brooks-html.html>Beau Brooks - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./beau-brooks-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
