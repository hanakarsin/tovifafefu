When you have so much overlap between contestants appearing on multiple seasons of <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a> or The Bachelor, it's bound to happen.</p><p>So when <a href=#>Blake Moynes</a> was announced as a surprise contestant for The Bachelorette with <a href=#>Katie Thurston</a>, it made some people wonder if they had already met before filming.</p><p>Some fans might remember Blake from Tayshia Adams' season of The Bachelorette, which means he is technically her ex. And since Tayshia is Katie's friend and one of the hosts of The Bachelorette in Katie's season, it wouldn't be totally surprising if Katie had met Blake through Tayshia before. It is the Bachelor Nation way, after all.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Katie and Blake know each other before 'The Bachelorette'?</h2><p>According to Bachelor alum Nick Viall, who appeared on Us Weekly's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here for the Right Reasons</a> podcast, Katie and Blake did meet prior to her season of The Bachelorette.</p><p>Nick claimed that from what he had heard, "It sounds like there was some dialogue between Katie and Blake."</p><p>He did admit that he didn't know if there was anything serious or intense between the two, but said he'd heard Blake and Katie had made contact.</p><p>Blake is also on <a href=#>Katie's season</a> right after being on both Tayshia and Clare Crawley's joint Bachelorette journey, though. Because of that, there may have been little room for him to have conversed with other women in the franchise before filming started, and Katie hasn't said that she and Blake knew each other prior to filming.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>WHOA WHOA WHOA!!! <a href=#>@tayshia</a> is playing matchmaker with Katie & Blake?!? <a href=#>#BacheloretteABC</a> <a href=#>#TheBachelorette</a> <a href=#>#BachelorNation</a> <a href=#>#TheBacheloretteABC</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gKMNXxWGMR</a></p>â€” RealityTVJunkieðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ (@BbcanHav3not) <a href=#>June 22, 2021</a></figure><p>"I will say, coming off my season with Matt [James], people were really shipping him and I before, so I was a little familiar with who he was and kind of his background," Katie said on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicks in the Office</a> podcast of Blake's later arrival in her season, compared to the other men.</p><p>Despite what Nick said about Katie and Blake talking before her season, she doesn't seem to have the same recollection. It's honestly a lot of he-said-she-said at this point.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Blake is also Tayshia's ex from her 'Bachelorette' season.</h2><p>When Clare's season of The Bachelorette ended with her choosing her match before the predetermined finale, her contestants were welcomed to stay on for Tayshia's subsequent season. Blake was among those men and seemed to fall hard for Tayshia. Unfortunately, he only made it to Week 9, which was pretty far, but not far along enough to propose.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>If Blake doesnâ€™t end up with Katie, will he be on Michelleâ€™s season too? <a href=#>#TheBachelorette</a></p>â€” Jade ðŸŒ¶ (@chastityjadebel) <a href=#>June 24, 2021</a></figure><p>Blake and Tayshia didn't work out, much like he and Clare didn't go very far. What that means for his chance of winning over Katie, who is Tayshia's friend, is still unclear for now.</p><p>What viewers can be sure of, though, according to the promos for the season, is that Blake falls for Katie almost as fast as he fell for Clare and Tayshia before.</p><p>Watch The Bachelorette on Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbalecqaq6KdXZa7pXnBpZiknV2gu7DDjJ6YnKBdpMGpsdFmmZ6en6eybq7AnJ%2BepJ%2BnsrXAxA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-katie-and-blake-know-each-other-before-bachelorette.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-katie-and-blake-know-each-other-before-bachelorette.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-katie-and-blake-know-each-other-before-bachelorette.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-katie-and-blake-know-each-other-before-bachelorette.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-katie-and-blake-know-each-other-before-bachelorette.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-katie-and-blake-know-each-other-before-bachelorette.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./stop-comparing-me-with-young-women-without-children-bbnaija-star-venita-sends-out-warning.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./stop-comparing-me-with-young-women-without-children-bbnaija-star-venita-sends-out-warning.html>'Stop Comparing Me With Young Women Without Children'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./busi-lurayi-cause-of-death.html>What Was Actress Busi Lurayi's Cause of Death?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./busi-lurayi-cause-of-death.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
