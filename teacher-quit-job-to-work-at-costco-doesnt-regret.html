The warehouse club chain took the No. 1 spot by paying well above the typical salary that other retail companies pay, even for entry-level workers, according to Indeed."</p><p>The outlet even quoted a review from one employee who extolled the company's "graduated wage program" that offers salary increases to workers who just show up and complete their shift hours. The more time you put into the company, the more your salary automatically goes up.</p><p>For folks who work in retail, this is a breath of fresh air, especially compared to other businesses, like Target, which is currently being slammed on social media for giving <a href=#>long-time employees an annual raise of 8 cents per hour</a>.</p><p>It's why it's probably not surprising that former teacher and TikToker Millennial Ms. Frizzle (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@millennialmsfrizz</a>) said she was happy that she trusted her "gut" and decided to leave the teaching profession to work in retail for Costco.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@millennialmsfrizz href=#>@millennialmsfrizz</a><p>As a teacher, I started my day with an armful of warm copies (if the machine was working).
